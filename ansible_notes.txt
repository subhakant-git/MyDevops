doubts in ansible
=================
Question-1
==========
The practice we did yesterday is a static inventory or dynamic inventory ?
Because it is written that dynamic inventory file is used for cloud machines.

Answer
======
static inventory file can have on-prem and cloud nodes/machines
dynamic inventory will have only cloud machines which has auto scaling and can be created only in cloud.

Question-2
==========
if ansible.cfg file is alreay present in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, then why are we creating it ?
Is it like we can create a new ansible.cfg file ? is this name fixed or we can keep any name ?

Answer
======
The default location for the main Ansible configuration file, ansible.cfg, is /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg. Ansible also searches for configuration files in other locations, but this is the system-wide default. 
Ansible looks for configuration files in the following order, stopping at the firstansible webserver -m shell -a "ls -l /tmp" one it finds: [1, 3]  

1. If the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable is set, it looks at the value of that variable. 
2. It checks for ansible.cfg in the current directory. 
3. It searches for ~/.ansible.cfg in the user's home directory. 
4. Finally, it checks /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg. 

commands to run on server
===========================
ansible webserver -m file -a "path=/tmp/directory state=directory mode=0755" -b
ansible webserver -m shell -a "ls -l /tmp"
